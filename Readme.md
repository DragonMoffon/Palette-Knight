# Palette Knight
Palette Knight is a top-down hack'n'slash Rouge-like MetroidVania. The primary goal of this game is to be
the backbone of the "Developing A Large Scale Game with Python Arcade" a Tutorial/Dev log series for the
YouTube channel Dragon's Bakery. 

The tutorial series hopes to cover a wide range of topics including planning, design principles, play testing, 
design considerations, fighting developer assumptions, polish, and development stages, identifying game traits,
building on concepts, accessibility.

But it will also explore topics specific to the genres of choice. Including world-building in a randomly generated 
world, mechanics vs story, building a unique feel, playing with perspective, developing C R U N C H, speed vs pretty.

This series is heavily inspired by the GMTK a wonderful YouTube channel which explores a wide range of game design 

### Notes
I have no real game development experience and this is as much an experiment for me as it is a tool for others.

There is also no promised release schedule as I am a university student whose work load will always be a priority.

### Episodes
No Episodes of the YouTube series have been released as of 15/06/2022.
